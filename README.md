Meet NFT-SHREDDER 

A refined fork https://github.com/nishantrpai/rarity-score which was kindly created for me by [@nishantrpai](https://github.com/nishantrpai)

NFT-SHREDDER is a tool which helps to manage your NFT collection and metadata review them for errors or incorrect image generation.
All your image and metadata information including image URL, name, ID, etc. ends up being neatly organised into 2 folders called images and metadata.

Make your collection shine!

[@nishantrpai](https://github.com/nishantrpai), thank you so much for coming up with such a great tool!
